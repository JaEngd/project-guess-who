# Project Name

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

The project is a game inspired by Go Fish where you get to find out which fish who's hiding in the reed. I used different methods, functions and statemnts like if/else for fintering the questions and a forEach loop to generate the board.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I had broblems with a character object when I named it to "color". I worked with the debug tool to solve it and by changing the object name.
